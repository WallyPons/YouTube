## 📂 About These Scripts

These are the **exact scripts** I use in videos — shared to help you follow along, test on your own environments, or adapt for your daily DBA tasks.

Each script:
- Is tested on **Microsoft SQL Server** (mostly 2016+)
- May include notes if relevant for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Azure or MySQL
- May include dummy/sample data where useful
